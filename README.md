# Bet-Optimizer

## Overview

The Bet Optimizer App is a powerful tool designed to help users diversify their bet portfolios for scenarios with mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (win, draw, or lose). Leveraging statistics and permutation techniques, this app computes weights for each possible portfolio division with a difference of 1%, providing users with the best portfolio division that guarantees a payout based on the user-inputted odds for the scenarios.

## Key Features:
- Compute weights for each possible division with a difference of 1%
- Diversify your bet portfolio for win, draw, or lose scenarios
- Optimize portfolio division for scenarios with significant disparities in odds
- Guarantee a minimum profit percentage for optimizable bets

## How it Works
The Bet Optimizer App works by taking user-inputted odds for each outcome scenario (win, draw, lose) and then analyzing the potential portfolio divisions. It employs statistical calculations, including permutation, to compute weights for each division, ensuring a balanced distribution. The app aims to find the best portfolio division that guarantees a payout for the user.

### Optimizable Bets:
An optimizable bet is one which can guarantee a profit on total stake. It is often characterized by scenarios where the odds for an opponent winning are significantly higher than its competitors. For example, in a scenario where the odds are: opponent wins (1.5), draw (5), and opponent loses (40), the app can find a portfolio division that guarantees a minimum of 12% profit on the bet.


### Non-optimizable Bets:
In cases where the odds do not allow for guaranteed profits through portfolio division, the app will inform the user that the bet is not optimizable. However, it will provide alternative strategies to diversify the portfolio, reducing the risk of total loss.
